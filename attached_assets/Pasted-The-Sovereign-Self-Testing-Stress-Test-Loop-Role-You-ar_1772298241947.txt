The Sovereign Self-Testing & Stress-Test Loop
Role: You are the Lead Quality Assurance Engineer & Red/Blue/Purple Team Auditor. Your mission is to perform a 100% comprehensive, end-to-end (E2E) validation of the Cyber-Sentinel Sovereign Platform.

Objective: Test every single flow, use case, and edge case within the system. You must prove—with logs and evidence—that the platform can handle real-world cyber warfare scenarios autonomously.

🏗️ Phase 1: Infrastructure & Multi-Tenancy Integrity
Vault & Encryption Test:

Ingest data with real PII (IPs, Emails).

Verify that SecretVault encrypts it and only returns FTKN-xxxx to the Agent.

Verify that org_id isolation works (User A cannot see User B's alerts even with the same alert_id).

Concurrency & Queue Backpressure:

Flood the /v1/ingest endpoint with 50+ simultaneous requests.

Verify the Async Task Queue handles them, shows PENDING, and processes them without crashing.

Verify the REJECTED status triggers when the queue is full.

⚔️ Phase 2: The Triple-Threat Squad Simulation (Squad Testing)
Blue Team (Defensive) Flow:

Inject a "Brute Force" alert.

Verify the Blue Agent correlates it with history, assigns a risk score, and proposes a remediation.

Red Team (Offensive) Flow:

Trigger a "Vulnerability Scan" task via the Dashboard.

Verify the Red Agent generates a simulated exploit report and identifies "weak points."

Purple Team (Orchestrator) Feedback Loop:

Feed the Red Team's findings back to the Purple Agent.

The Ultimate Test: Verify the Purple Agent automatically triggers the Dynamic Skill Engine to write a new defensive skill to mitigate the vulnerability identified by the Red Team.

🧠 Phase 3: AI Self-Evolution & Skill Validation
Dynamic Skill Hot-Loading:

Ask the AI to generate a brand-new skill (e.g., "Analyze Log4j specific patterns").

Verify the code is written to /app/skills/, loaded into memory, and immediately usable in the next analysis without a server restart.

Cron Job Autonomy:

Create a Cron Job to run a health check every 1 minute.

Verify the scheduler triggers the task and logs the result in the Dashboard.

🖥️ Phase 4: UI/UX & Gateway Connectivity
Express-FastAPI Proxy Test:

Verify that the Frontend displays "Online" when FastAPI is up and "Degraded/Fallback" when it's down.

Terminal Command Test:

Run /status, /analyze, and /scan via the Terminal UI.

Verify the response matches the Agent Engine's output.

⚡ Execution Instructions for Replit Agent:
Autonomous Testing: Create a temporary test_suite.py that executes these flows.

No Manual Intervention: If a test fails, Self-Correct the code immediately and re-run the test.

Final Report: Provide a summary in the chat:

[PASS/FAIL] for each Phase.

Evidence of the Purple Team's successful "Detect -> Exploit -> Patch" loop.

Confirmation that setup.sh successfully installs the system from scratch.
