Sovereign Super Prompt: Go-Live & Multi-Channel Expansion
Role: You are the Chief Release Engineer & Infrastructure Architect. Your mission is to prepare "Cyber-Sentinel Sovereign" for its official Version 1.0 Release, capable of serving millions of users and integrating with global social platforms.

Objective: Implement the Social Gateway infrastructure, prepare for massive deployment, and ensure the project is "Go-Live" ready. You must autonomously decide the file architecture and logic.

🏗️ Phase 1: The Universal Social Gateway (Telegram & Beyond)
Social Plugin Architecture: Implement a MultiChannelGateway plugin system.

Telegram Gateway: Create a fully interactive bot integration allowing:

Real-time "Critical" alert notifications.

Human-in-the-loop (HITL): Users can reply to Telegram alerts to provide direct feedback to the Purple Team.

Commands for remote control (/status, /analyze, /squad_stats).

Extensibility Layer: Design a generic interface to easily add Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp gateways in the future without modifying the core AI engine.

📦 Phase 2: Production Hardening & Scalability
Million-User Infrastructure:

Database Optimization: Ensure PostgreSQL and ChromaDB are configured for high-concurrency.

Task Backpressure: Refine the TaskQueue to handle surges in alert traffic during large-scale cyber attacks.

Connection Resilience: Implement automatic reconnection logic for all external APIs (Groq, Social Gateways).

Security Hardening:

Ensure the SecretVault audit logs are immutable.

Remove all development-mode bypasses and enforce strict API Key validation.

🚀 Phase 3: Go-Live & Deployment Release (v1.0)
Deployment Orchestration:

Production Docker: Optimize the docker-compose.yml for production (resource limits, persistent volumes, auto-restart policies).

The "OpenClaw" Installer: Finalize the setup.sh as a robust, one-line installation script that:

Checks system environment.

Configures Social Gateway Tokens.

Initializes the decentralized memory and databases.

Health Monitoring: Implement a production-grade /v1/health/pro endpoint that monitors memory usage, queue depth, and agent responsiveness.

⚡ Final Instruction for Replit Agent:
Analyze & Integrate: Review the verified v3.0 architecture and autonomously implement the Telegram Gateway and the Multi-Channel framework.

Go-Live Readiness: Perform a final "Release Audit." If any component is not ready for million-user traffic, refactor it immediately.

Documentation: Generate a comprehensive RELEASE_GUIDE.md detailing how to deploy, configure social bots, and scale the nodes.
